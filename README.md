# Using-mapreduce-and-hashset-to-get-max-min-average-in-a-large-data-set

Traditionally, we don't use Hive or mapreduce to manipulate column addition. Since mapreduce is more confortable about batch processing, operation line by line. This time we will use HashMap to store value each time when mapreduce processing data. Therefore we can get cumulative data and get max, min, average value for one column. This project shed a light in mapreduce column operation.
